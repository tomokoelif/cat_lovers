## Overview

Cat Lovers is a social media and booking app for cat rescue organizations. Users can:

 -Join the Cat Lovers community
 -Create your own profile
 -Add and interact with posts
 -Create and manage reservations
 -Upload photos
 -Learn more about Cat Cafe, Cat Hotel

Cat Lovers is accessible from all browsers and is fully responsive on different screen sizes. Its purpose is to create a safe and informed community where cat lovers can browse cute cat photos, interact with each other at Cat Cafe, and make essential bookings for Cat Hotel reservations. I created this site to help people find homes for rescue cats. I want people to first get interested in the photos on the site, play with the cats at the cat cafe, and then become a foster parent. I also run a cat hotel where you can leave your own cat while traveling.

Cat Lovrs allows you to book a cat hotel for a night or a month through a basic booking system.
In future developments of this project, I would like to provide users with an upgraded booking system with payment options, and the opportunity to connect with other cat lovers who have compatible cats through adding friends and direct messaging.
